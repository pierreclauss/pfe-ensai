# Equity portfolio construction and efficient diversification with climate risks

With the help of quantitative methodologies (bayesian, factor models for instance), the objective of this project is to improve diversification of equity portfolios in high volatility conditions with emerging climate risks (transition and physical risks).

Data will be based on stock prices and ESG ratings (open source), and the use of R and __tidyverse__ & __tidyquant__ universe will be encouraged.
